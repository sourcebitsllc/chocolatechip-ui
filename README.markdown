#ChocolateChip - A Compact JavaScript Framework for Mobile Web Apps

###ChocolateChip-UI has been acquired by [Sourcebits Inc](http://www.sourcebits.com).

##ChocolateChip-UI

ChocolateChip-UI is a framework for making mobile Web apps. It has three components: semantic HTML5 markup, CSS and JavaScript. To successfully make an app with ChocolateChip-UI you'll need at least moderate experience working with JavaScript. This is so you can use templates, make Ajax requests and handle callbacks for user interaction. If this is beyond your current skills, consider getting someone with Web development experience to help you.

If, on the other hand, you have experience with Web development, you'll be right at home. ChocolateChip-UI uses semantic HTML5 markup and attributes. Because the themes are just CSS, you can customize the look and feel of them as needed by modifying the CSS. With ChocolateChip-UI you write one app with its layouts, widgets and user interactions. Then you provide the correct CSS theme for the target operating system. You can do this on the server so that it is seamless for the user.

ChocolateChip-UI uses its own JavaScript library, ChocolateChip, for DOM manipulation, Ajax requests, etc. It is very similar to jQuery. It was built specifically to enable the creation of ChocolateChip-UI. It is optimized for mobile devices. That means it's small and focused. It's much smaller than jQuery and loads quickly. It is not a clone of jQuery. This means that jQuery plugins will not work with ChocolateChip-UI unless they are refactored to do so. If you already know jQuery, it's not that hard to learn ChocolateChip.

###jQuery Support

As of version 3.0.3, ChocolateChip-UI supports jQuery 2.0.3. Just change the link for chocolatechip.js to jQuery. Including jQuery as the library allows you to use jQuery coding patterns and plugins with your ChocolateChip-UI apps.
